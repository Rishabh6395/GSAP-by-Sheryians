## About

This repository contains various code snippets, demos, and examples to help you practice animations using GSAP. You’ll find examples ranging from basic animations to more complex sequences that showcase GSAP's capabilities.

## Prerequisites

To run the code here, you'll need:
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- A basic understanding of GSAP (recommended but not necessary, as the code is well-commented).

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   First, clone the repository or your forked version to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/gsap-practice-sheryians.git
   cd gsap-practice-sheryians
   
2. **Open the Project**
   Open the project folder in your favorite code editor (e.g., VSCode).
   
3. **Install Dependencies**
   Some projects may require additional dependencies, which you can install with:

   ```bash
   npm install
  If dependencies aren’t necessary, simply open the index.html files in your browser to see the animations in action!

 ##Usage
  Navigate to the folder or file you're interested in, open it in your code editor, and explore the code.
  Each file is designed to demonstrate a different GSAP feature or effect.
  Modify the code to experiment with different animation properties, easing options, durations, and other GSAP parameters.
